  - Title: Thank You for Playing!
    Body: "We hope you enjoyed your time terraforming and learning about Titan! We
      have one more thing we want to tell you about before we\u2019re done.\r"
  - Title: Scientific Accuracy (Part 1)
    Body: While we did our best to create an equally scientific and engaging experience
      This simulation is not meant to be 100% accurate to reality!
  - Title: Scientific Accuracy (Part 2)
    Body: Physical simulation of planets is an incredibly complex task. The systems
      we simulate here are just part of the full picture.
  - Title: Your Journey from Here
    Body: "Thank you again for playing our game! There is so much more to explore
      in the world of astronomy and we hope we were able to teach you something you
      didn\u2019t know before!\r\n\r\nAll the best,\r\nTung & Paul"
